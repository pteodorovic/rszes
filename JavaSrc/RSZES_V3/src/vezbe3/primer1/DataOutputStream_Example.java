/*
        Note the loop above is used to read the data from the DataInputStream. 
        Normally, when data is read, you see loops like this:


        while ((input = in.read()) != null) {
    
        . . .

        }

        The read method returns a value, null, which indicates that the end of the file has been reached. 

        Many of the DataInputStream read methods can't do this, because any value that could be returned to indicate the end of 
        file may also be a legitimate value read from the stream. 

        For example, suppose that you want to use -1 to indicate end of file.  Well, you can't, because -1 is a legitimate value
        that can be read from the input stream, using readDouble, readInt, or one of the other methods that reads numbers. 

        So DataInputStreams read methods throw an EOFException instead. When the EOFException occurs, the while (true) terminates.
